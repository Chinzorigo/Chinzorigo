- 👋 Hi, I’m @Chinzorigo
- 👀 I’m interested in frontend, middleware, backend, database and kubernetes.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning mongodb, node.js, express.js, firebase, api, github, docker and kubernetes. I will shift to Next JS once comfortable with React.
- 💞️ I’m looking for an opportunity on the MERN stack project heavily on the backend.
